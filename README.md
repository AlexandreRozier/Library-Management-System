# Library-Management-System

<img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/paomedia/small-n-flat/128/book-bookmark-icon.png"/>

This project consists in a **complete library management system**. It handles via its command-line interface various types of customers, library items, penalties for giving
back late the books, and many other points.

One builds a library by providing the number of rooms, shelves, bookcases and the miscellaneous items populating it. Then, a timer runs in background
to update each day the library : it **automatically applies penalties** to late members, and **handles the borrowing and returning of items**
according to their status (borrowable or not, available,...).

The main strength of this code is that thanks to the use of varied **design patterns**, it is easily **extendable** and **maintainable**. It 
is under the MIT license, so feel free to use it !
